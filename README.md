# 📊 Rainfall vs Agricultural Productivity in India - Power BI Dashboard

This project analyzes the relationship between **rainfall trends** and **agricultural productivity** across Indian states from 1966 to 2017. Using Power BI, the dashboard visualizes seasonal, temporal, and geographic variations in crop yields, rainfall, and their correlation.

---

## 🌾 Objective

To support agricultural stakeholders in **data-driven decision-making** by revealing:

- Rainfall patterns across years
- Regional differences in crop productivity
- Seasonal yield variations
- Correlations between rainfall and crop performance

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop**
- Data transformation using **Power Query**
- Visualizations: Line Charts, Bar Charts, Maps, Scatter Plots, and Slicers

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features

### 1. **Temporal Rainfall Trends**
- Line chart showing average rainfall during June–September over the years (1966–2017)

### 2. **Correlation Between Rainfall and Crop Yields**
- Scatter plots comparing total rainfall vs yield for various crops
- Insights into which crops are rainfall-dependent (e.g., Sugarcane, Rice) vs resilient (e.g., Barley, Chickpea)

### 3. **Geographic Variations in Productivity**
- Map visuals comparing average crop yields across Indian states
- Identifies high-performing regions (Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh) and low-performing ones (Jharkhand, Assam, Bihar)

### 4. **Seasonal Yield Analysis**
- Bar Charts comparing rainfall amounts to crop yields.
- Highlights productivity variations by region.

### 5. **Interactive Filtering**
- Slicers for Year, State, Season, and Crop Type
- Allows users to explore the data dynamically

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Rainfall is inconsistent** year-over-year, impacting crop planning.
- **Correlation with rainfall varies by crop**:
  - High: Sugarcane, Rice, Wheat
  - Low/Neutral: Barley, Castor, Chickpea
- **Geographic disparities** in yield performance
- **Rabi crops** show more yield stability than **Kharif crops**

---

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Region-Specific Crop Strategies**
   - Focus on high-yield crops based on state-level performance
2. **Invest in Water Management**
   - Use micro-irrigation and rainwater harvesting in rainfall-volatile areas
3. **Promote Crop Diversification**
   - Tailor crop choices based on rainfall trends and historical performance

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
2. Use slicers to filter data by:
   - Year
   - State
   - Crop Type
   - Season
3. Analyze the trends and compare productivity insights regionally and temporally
